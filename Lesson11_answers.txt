- What is the difference between var and let ?
 * var is the original way to declare a variable in JS. ES2015 added let (and const). 
 * var is saved in the window object, making it very powerful. let is not saved to the window object. 
 * var has function scope, let has block scope. 
 * var gets hoisted, let does not. 
 * var can be redeclared, let can not.

- What is hoisting?
Hoisting is where a var's are hoisted to the top of the code for processing regardless of its actual location in the code.
The var is declared towards the beginning of the load, regardless of where it is located in the code. 
The hoisted declaration is just that, and is not assigned yet, that assignment does not get hoisted, 
it remains in its location in the code and is assigned when the compiler gets to that line of code.
